# Flinstone-OS

This project contains a toy shell and a small experimental kernel. The shell
builds and runs on Linux using SQLite and libsodium. The kernel and bootloader
can be run in an emulator for testing.

See `README.txt` for build instructions and `simulate_os.sh` for running the
kernel under QEMU. A VirtualBox version is available via
`simulate_os_virtualbox.sh`.
